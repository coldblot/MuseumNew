    "WhatisUPI":"Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) is a payment application that allows users to make instant bank transfers using UPI. You can make 24X7 bank-to-bank payments instantly and receive funds using just your mobile number or Virtual Payment Address (UPI ID) or by scanning the QR code on the app.",

From there, it is transmitted to the payee’s Payment Service Provider, which authenticates the details and responds to UPI. UPI confirms the same to your bank to debit the amount from your account.

  "NACH":{
    "History":"Before banks got connected to the internet, clearing of cheques used to take several days due to multiple electronic clearing systems of different banks. Responding to a felt need for an automated clearing house for high-volume and repetitive financial transactions, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) introduced the National Automated Clearing House (NACH) in 2016.",
    "WhatisUPI":"NACH is a digital platform for high-volume interbank electronic transactions. Banks, financial institutions, corporates and the government are using NACH for making bulk transactions like the distribution of subsidies, dividends, interest, salary, pension etc. and for the collection of repetitive payments like utility bills and insurance premiums. NACH has harmonized and consolidated ECS or Electronic Clearing Service of different banks.",
    "Advantages":"NACH ensures instant, near real-time transaction processing across India compared to traditional processes. It does away the need for manual reconciliation, verification, and transmission of paper documents. Repetitive transactions can be instantly processed without the need for paper transmission across geographical distances. All this means less paperwork and eliminates manual handling of redo repetitive transactions.",
    "Howitworks":"In ECS, the mandate to debit funds from one’s account to pay a monthly instalment was physically exchanged between banks and it took up to 30 working days. With NACH, banks can send the mandate image along with data instead of the physical mandate. Customers can issue e-Mandate to authorise transactions by themselves. NACH acts as a mega clearing house connecting banks and customers on both ends through well-defined protocols and standards.",
    "Easeofaccess":"NACH’s Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB) System helps government agencies implement the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme by channelizing the government subsidies and benefits to the intended beneficiaries using the Aadhaar numbers.

  },
"IMPS":{
    "History":"The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an entity created by RBI, launched Immediate Payment Services (IMPS) in 2010. Till then, there was no provision for the transfer of funds 24x7x365 in real-time in India. Funds using the existing systems, Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT), could be transferred only during banking hours.",
    "WhatisUPI":"IMPS is an instant, 24X7, interbank electronic fund transfer service that could be accessed on multiple channels like mobile phones, Internet banking, ATM and SMS. IMPS allows transferring of funds instantly within banks across India which is safe and economical.",

IMPS can be used to receive foreign inward remittances.",
    "Howitworks":"For using IMPS on mobile or SMS or through the net banking portal, a customer should register for mobile/internet banking or SMS banking with an individual bank. For transferring or receiving funds using the mobile phone, the user should get the 7-digit Mobile Money Identifier (MMID). The combination of MMID and mobile number is uniquely linked with an account number, facilitating the money transfer.",
    "Easeofaccess":"For all bank account holders, IMPS has paved the way for the transfer of money through various channels and eliminates the need to go to a bank branch. There is no need to write a cheque or make a demand draft for paying someone. IMPS initiated a revolution in digital payments in India."

"DigitialRupee":{
    "History":"Private virtual currencies - known as cryptocurrencies – are becoming popular but they are not commodities and have no intrinsic value. They are not regulated by any central bank. In light of technological changes, central banks are considering issuing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC). In December 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the launch of retail digital Rupee (e₹-R) on a trial basis.",
    "WhatisUPI":"RBI defines CBDC as the legal tender issued by a central bank in a digital form. It is akin to sovereign paper currency but takes a different form. It shall be exchangeable at par with the existing currency and shall be accepted as a medium of payment, legal tender and a safe store of value.",
    "Advantages":"IMPS can be used to transfer funds in multiple ways - person to person, person to account and person to merchant remittances – through mobile, internet and ATMs. Funds amounting up to Rs. 5 lakhs can be transferred daily, and the service can be availed beyond banking hours and on holidays too. IMPS can be used to receive foreign inward remittances.",
    "Howitworks":"The pilot project is to test the process of digital rupee creation, distribution and retail usage in real time. Eight banks have been identified for phase-wise participation in this project. It covers select locations in closed user groups (CUG) comprising participating customers and merchants. The e₹-R would be issued in the same denominations that paper currency and coins are currently issued. Different features and applications of the e₹-R token and architecture will be tested in future pilots.",
    "Easeofaccess":"CBDC is aimed at complementing, rather than replacing, physical money and is envisaged to provide an additional payment avenue to users. Supported by all the features of the current payment systems like safety and security, the Digital Rupee (e₹) system will boost India’s digital economy and make the monetary and payment systems more efficient."

"PlasticMoney ":{
    "History":"Plastic money refers to a form of payment that enables consumers to make transactions without spending cash. Cashless payments can be done by using credit and debit cards issued by different banks. These cards have been in vogue for a long time, but the use of plastic money in India became popular after the process of economic liberalization began in 1991.",
    "WhatisUPI":"The term ‘Plastic Money’ is normally used for debit and credit cards. A debit card enables an account holder to withdraw money from his account using the card at an ATM and pay at merchant points or buy things online. A credit card is used in the same way but the customer can pay to the bank later. It is a Buy Now, Pay Later or BNPL card. Both debit and credit cards carry logos of Visa or MasterCard along with the issuing bank’s name. Visa and MasterCard are payment systems that support banks around the world. RuPay is an Indian card system.",
    "Advantages":"Credit and debit cards offer a convenient way of executing electronic transactions in physical as well as online stores. However, they come with transaction fees charged by banks as well as fees and interest for providing credit. One of the major differences between a RuPay card and foreign cards (American Express,  MasterCard and Visa) is the operating cost. Since RuPay supports transactions within India only, merchants and banks pay less service charges compared to other cards.",
    "Howitworks":"When you swipe a credit card in a store, your card details are sent to the merchant’s bank. The bank gets authorization from the credit card network (Master, Visa, RuPay) to process the transaction. The card issuer then verifies the information and either approves or declines the transaction. If the transaction is approved, the payment is made to the merchant and your card’s available credit is reduced by the transaction amount. Debit cards function in the same way but the amount is debited straight away from the bank account.",
    "Easeofaccess":"The biggest advantage of using a credit card is the ease of use and safety. Issuing banks and merchants offer rewards or cash back which act as an incentive to use the card. On the flip side, credit cards come with high interest rates, which can be expensive if you don’t pay your balance in full monthly."
